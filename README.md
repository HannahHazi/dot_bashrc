# dot_bashrc
Tweaks I have made to my .bashrc to make my bash prompt more useful

First mod: adding which Python virtual environment I am in
Second mod: add colours and text to show when I'm using git, and which branch I'm on.

Note that when using this on Mac you'll have to copy across the .bash_profile to your local directory ~ as well, because Bash on Mac doesn't pick up .bashrc automatically (I think because Mac defaults to using login shell).
